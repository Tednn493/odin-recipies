    <h1>Lasagne Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagne.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced yellow onion/li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>7 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup dry red wine/li>
        <li>1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>Pasta sheets</li>
        <li>Bachamel sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li>
        <li>Taste the ragu and adjust salt. Remove from heat and add milk; stir well and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread a bit of the ragu sauce over the base of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of pasta. Top with a spoonful of sauce and bechamel. Add a spoonful of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top with another layer of pasta. Add more sauce, bechamel, and cheese. Repeat layers until you reach the top; finish with a layer of pasta, bechamel, and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at room temperature before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
